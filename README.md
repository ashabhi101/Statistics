Statistics for Data Science & ML Interviews
This repository is a curated collection of Jupyter notebooks covering core statistics topics essential for data science, machine learning, and analytical roles. Each notebook includes clear definitions, intuitive explanations, and practical examples designed for interview prep and day-to-day application.

üìÅ Topics Covered
Each topic is in its own self-contained notebook:

Descriptive Statistics

    Central tendency, dispersion, and distribution shape.

Probability Fundamentals

    Basic rules, conditional probability, independence, and Bayes‚Äô theorem.

Probability Distributions

    Discrete and continuous distributions including Normal, Binomial, Poisson, and Exponential.

Inferential Statistics

    Sampling, point estimates, confidence intervals, and margin of error.

Hypothesis Testing

    Null/alternative hypotheses, p-values, significance levels, t-tests, ANOVA, chi-square tests.

Statistical Power & Sample Size

    Type I/II errors, effect size, and designing statistically sound experiments.

Correlation & Covariance

    Measuring relationships and identifying multicollinearity.

Regression Analysis

    Simple linear regression, assumptions, R¬≤, and inference on coefficients.

Bayesian Statistics

    Priors, posteriors, MAP vs MLE, and comparisons to frequentist approaches.

Resampling Techniques

    Bootstrap, jackknife, and cross-validation for model evaluation and stability.

Statistical Biases
    
    Common pitfalls in experimental design and data interpretation.

Time Series Basics (Optional)
    
    Concepts like stationarity, trend, and autocorrelation with practical examples.

Tools Used
